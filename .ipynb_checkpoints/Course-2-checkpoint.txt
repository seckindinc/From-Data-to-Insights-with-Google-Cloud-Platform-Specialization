- Temprorary or Permanent Table

    - All Query Results are saved to either a Temprorary or Permanent Table
    - If you specify a Destination Table then that table becomes Permanent, otherwise it is a new Temprorary Table
    - Temprorary Tables are the basis of Query Cached Results
    - Temprorary Tables last 24 hours only
    
- Cache

    - Cache = Faster Results. Cache is selected by default.
    - Cache is not used when;
    
        - Underlying table(s) updated
        - Deterministic queries used(like CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
        - Cache disabled in Show Options
        
- Storing results in a View

    - View = Saved SQL Query(a virtual table)
    - The underlying query is re-ran each time the view is queried
