Week 1 

- Temprorary or Permanent Table

    - All Query Results are saved to either a Temprorary or Permanent Table
    - If you specify a Destination Table then that table becomes Permanent, otherwise it is a new Temprorary Table
    - Temprorary Tables are the basis of Query Cached Results
    - Temprorary Tables last 24 hours only
    
- Cache

    - Cache = Faster Results. Cache is selected by default.
    - Cache is not used when;
    
        - Underlying table(s) updated
        - Deterministic queries used(like CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
        - Cache disabled in Show Options
        
- Storing results in a View

    - View = Saved SQL Query(a virtual table)
    - The underlying query is re-ran each time the view is queried
    
Week 2

- We can ingest data permanently into BigQuery from a variety of formats;

    - Cloud Storage
    - Google Drive
    - Cloud Dataprep
    - Cloud BigTable
    - Csv, Json, Avro
    
- External table is like a pointer to the file. It is not stored in BigQuery managed storage and we can't benefit from the permanent table perks, like cache.

- Partitioned tables

    A partitioned table is a special table that is divided into segments, called partitions, that make it easier to manage and query your data. By dividing a large table into smaller partitions, you can improve query performance, and you can control costs by reducing the number of bytes read by a query.

    There are two types of table partitioning in BigQuery:

    - Tables partitioned by ingestion time: Tables partitioned based on the data's ingestion (load) date or arrival date.
    - Partitioned tables: Tables that are partitioned based on a TIMESTAMP or DATE column.
    
    Tables without partitions need to be scanned for all the records to see whether they satisfy the date-matching condition in the Where clause. 

    Query below creates a partitioned table with the partition column date. date column was created in the select statement. 

    #standardSQL
     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.days_with_rain
     PARTITION BY date
     OPTIONS (
       partition_expiration_days=90,
       description="weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"
     ) AS
     SELECT
       DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
       (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
        WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
       prcp
     FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
     WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
       AND prcp > 0      -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation
       AND _TABLE_SUFFIX = CAST( EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE()) AS STRING)
  
- BigQuery Table Wildcards

    When there are lots of table needs to be merged with union method it is not feasible to union one by one. If the table names have a suffix or prefix pattern we can query them with wildcard operators. 
    
    - Query below selects all columns from the tables start with gsod name;
    
        select *
        from `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
        
    - Filtering tables with a certain pattern of suffix;
    
        select *, _TABLE_SUFFIX as table_year
        from `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
        where _TABLE_SUFFIX > '1950'

- Table Joins

    - We can do joins between a table and bulk of tables which were selected with wildcards.
    - Joining on Non-Unique fields explode your dataset
    
Week 3

- Dimensions and Measures

    - Dimensions
    
        A field that can be considered an independent variable. Usually contains qualitative, categorical information.
        
        Examples;
        
            - Name
            - Location
            - Job title
        
    - Measures
    
        A field that is a dependent variable; that is, the value is a function of one or more dimensions. e.g. any field contains numeric (quantitive) information.
        
        Examples; 
        
            - Revenue
            - Salary
            - Expenses
