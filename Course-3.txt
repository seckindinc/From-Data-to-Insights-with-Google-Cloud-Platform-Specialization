Week 1

- Approximate Aggregate Functions

    - Count(distinct) vs Approx_count_distinct()
    
- Navigation Functions

    - LEAD(): Returns the value of a row n rows ahead of the current row
    - LAG(): Returns the value of a row n rows behind the current row
    - NTH_VALUE(): returns the value of the nth value in the window

Select *, RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY department ORDER BY start date ) AS rank
From table
WHERE rank = 1;

- User Defined Functions

    - CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION: Creates a new function. A function can contain zero or more named_parameters
    - RETURNS[data_type]: Specifies the data type that the function returns.
    - LANGUAGE[language]: Specifies the language for the function.
    - AS[external_code]: Specifies the code that the function runs.

CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION multiplyImputs(x FLOAT64, y FLOAT64)
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE js AS """
	return x*y;
""";

WITH numbers as(
select 1 as x, 5 as y)

select multiplyImputs(8,4)
from numbers

    - Concurrent UDF function count is 6.

- Traditional Relational Database Architect

    - Adding new columns to existing schema regarding to the new business models will cause wider tables with full off null or 0 values.
    
- BigQuery Architecture 
    
    - Column-Based data storage: Rows and columns are stored in compressed format in Google Colossus. Columns are individually compressed. Access values from a few columns without reading every column.
        
    - Break apart tables into pieces: Tables are speerated into small shards and called upon to the query.BigQuery automatically pieces it all back together for queries. Shards of data are read and processed in parallel.
    
    BigQuery automatically balances and scales workers. Up to 2000 workers to process concurrent queries.
    
    Each worker is a virtual machine.

    BiqQuery workers communicate by shuffiling data in-memory
    
        - Workers consume data values and perform operations in parallel
        - Workers produce output to the in-memory shuffle service
        - Workers consume new data and continue processing
        
    BigQuery shuffling enables massive scale
    
        - Shuffle allows BigQuery to process massively parallel petabyte-scale data jobs
        - Everything after query execution is automatically scaled and managed
        - All queries, large and small, use shuffle
    
    - Store nested fields within a table: Rows are stored in parent - child relationships so we can store any parent with related child information in a nested way.
    
    Normalized table format;
    
    people     cities_lived
          
    name  -->  name
    age        city
    gender     years_lieved
    
    Denormalized table format;

- Working with Repeated Fields

    - Introducing Arrays and Structs: 
    
        - Arrays are ordered list of zero or more data values that must have the same data type.
        
        create table array__
        as
        select ['a','b','c'] as array_
        
        select * from array__
        
        Row array_
        1   a
            b
            c
            
        select ARRAY_LENGTH(array_) as array_size
        
        Row array_size
        1   3
    
    - Flattening Arrays: CROSS JOIN and UNNEST flattens arrays so we can access elements
    
    select items, customer_name
    from UNNEST(['a','b','c']) as items
    CROSS JOIN
    (select 'dummy' as column_name)
    
    Row item column_name
    1   a    dummy
    2   b    dummy
    3   c    dummy
    
        - ARRAY_AGG function allows us to create arrays from rows. 
        
            select ARRAY_AGG(item) as items 
            from table

            select ARRAY_AGG(item order by item)
            from table
    
        - STRUCTs are flexible containers. 
        
            STRUCTs are a container of ordered fields each with a type (required) and field name (optional).
            
            You can store multiple data types in a STRUCT (even Arrays).
            
            One STRUCT can have many values, looks and behaves similar to a table.
            
            ARRAYS can contain STRUCTs as values
            
            select STRUCT(35 as age, 'Jacob' as name) as customer
            
            select STRUCT(35 as age, 'Jacob' as name, ['apple','pear','peach'] as items) as customer
            
            select 
            [STRUCT(35 as age, 'Jacob' as name, ['apple','pear','peach'] as items),
             STRUCT(33 as age, 'Miranda' as name, ['apple','pear','water'] as items)
            ] AS customers
            
            WITH orders as (              
                select [
                STRUCT(35 as age, 'Jacob' as name, ['apple','pear','peach'] as items),
                STRUCT(33 as age, 'Miranda' as name, ['apple','pear','water'] as items)
                ] AS customers
                )

                select customers from orders as o cross join UNNEST(o.customers) as customers where 'water' in UNNEST(customers.items)            
    
    We can use the syntax below to use nested fields without CROSS JOIN and UNNEST
    
    SELECT
      ein,
      expense
    FROM `data-to-insights.irs_990.irs_990_repeated` n, n.expense_struct AS expense
    WHERE expense.type = 'Legal'
    ORDER BY expense.amount DESC
    LIMIT 10
    
- Data Studio

    There are 2 parts to Data Studio cache: the query cache and prefetch cache

    When all the carts in the report are being served from a cache, a lightning bolt icon appears in the bottom right corner.

    Break both caches in Edit mode using Refresh cache 

    You should turn off prefect cache if your data changes frequently 

    Sharing a report does not share direct access to any added data

    Data sources must be shared separately from reports
